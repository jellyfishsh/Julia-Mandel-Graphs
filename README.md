# Julia-Mandel-Graphs
A graphical tool to visualize Mandelbrot and Julia sets.

## Why?
I wanted to code something *kinda* on my own in C, so I want to try and program the Mandelbrot and Julia Sets.

## Contributing:
This is kinda just a basic coding project for my own amusement. 
If you want to contribute cool things, fork and make pull requests so I can see the cool things.
